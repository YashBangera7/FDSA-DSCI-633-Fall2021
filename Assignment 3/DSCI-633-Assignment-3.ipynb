    "1. Your assignment should be completed by filling in the empty solution cells in this Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb). Feel free to add more cells as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Please comment your code using either markdown or #comments and use meaningful variable names to make it as readable and intelligible as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write your code in the form of functions. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "    def my_code ():\n",

    "4. If the problem is to find the value of 'x', printing 'x = (your answer)' will help us identify if your code worked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For code that refers to local data files downloaded from the internet, please keep the file path simple (e.g. ~/downloads/datafilename) so that it works on our copy of the dataset. Please do not modify either the filename or the file contents in any way.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Solution to problems that do not require any coding can be typed up in their own cells using markdown.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. Unless there are legitimate circumstances, late assignments will not be accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. All assignments are individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. All the sources used for problem solution must be acknowledged, e.g. web sites, books, research papers, etc.\n",
